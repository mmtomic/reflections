What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When I initialize a repository an empty .git catalogue is created. I need to do it to tell Git which files I want to have in my repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a temporary area where files can be added and, I assume, removed from. It is temporary unlike the working directory and repository. It only contains files that have been added to it manually. It offers me a possibility to manipulate which files will be in the commit, it gives me a chance to change my mind before I do an irreversible commit.
