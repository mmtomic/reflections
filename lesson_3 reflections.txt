1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I'd like my work to be accessible on a remote repository when working from two or more machines far away from each other (work and home) and when collaborating with others on the same project. It is also preferable in case I need help, so that someone else, who knows more than me, can give me some input on which changes I could make.  

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

It gives me more freedom to choose which changes I want to include in the work that I've done locally - I can choose a branch to pull from, and only have changes that are relevant for the work I am doing. Pulling all the changes at once, from several branches, might be overwhelming when many people are working together. It is not necessarry. 

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forking is cloning but only on GitHub. Cloning can happen locally or from a remote to local machine. It means to copy a repository. Branching can happen on a local machine or on GitHub. Branching is used to copy the existing repository and make it possible to work on it separately from other people. 

4. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

The benefit is that I can review changes on the remote without needing an internet connection. I can also do a merge and continue working locally.
